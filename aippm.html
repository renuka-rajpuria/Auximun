								<h4><font color="grey">Dear Delegates,</p>	<p>We are still feudal, but what has distressed me is that many good persons have been denied tickets because the trusted courtiers had labelled them as anti-Nehru."
                                         - Ahmed Azad.<br><br>
With Patel gone and Prasad elevated to presidentship, Nehru became all-powerful and felt free to shape domestic policies. As the country was getting ready for its first general election in 1952, he simultaneously took overall command of the Congress Party to personally fashion poll strategy and choose new rulers. There was a great rush for Congress tickets because of the general feeling that "even a lamp post carrying the Congress ticket will win." As was natural, many candidates made allegations of corruption, immorality and black marketing aganist there rivals. 
<br><br>The Congress won the general election, and that gave birth to a new phase on India's political life, namely the emergence on top of courtiers,sycophants and hangers-on. 
According to the history that we have been taught, the Congress Party fought day in and out to free the country of external colonial power to set up there own. It has been pretty easy for Nehru and for the Gandhi family ever since. But if you are ready to unleash the truth beneath these few pages of an old history book and delve deep and think what would the country be if Congress didn't work like a supreme authority? What would the country be Nehru wasn't the Prime Minister at all? If you are one who wants to know the answers to these, or maybe just experience what it would have been like to work on the future the country , welcome to Indian General Election 1950-1952
 commitee at AUXIMUN'19 on the 29th and 30th of July.
